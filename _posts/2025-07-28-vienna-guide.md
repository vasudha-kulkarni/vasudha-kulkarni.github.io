## Cafes

Vienna is famous for it's cafe culture - you can order a cup of coffee and stick around for hours, working or chatting with friends. This is one of my favourite things about the city. My current top choice for amazing coffee and great vibe is *Kleines Wiener Cafe* in the 8th district. If you want to see my big list of cafes in Vienna, here's a [Google maps link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9bDhGpuSVZVXzCwHA). Enjoy a cup of coffee with the famous Sachertorte! 

- Good for coffee + work - *Coffee Pirates, Das Cafe*
- Amaaazing for take-away coffee - *GOTA Coffee Experts, Fenster Cafe*
- Good vibe to hangout, read or meet friends - *Kleines Wiener Cafe, phil, Cafe Kafka, Carl Ludwig Cafe*
- Old-timey Viennese coffee house (but not crowded) - *Cafe Savoy, Cafe Schopenhauer*

## Restaurants

My third favourite thing about living in Vienna (after the public transport and cafes), is the variety of options in restaurants and the cuisines. I have tried a lot of places and my favourite so far Gaon Korean Restaurant near Westbahnhof and amazing tacos at La Taqueria Chiquitata on Margaretenstrasse. But based on what cuisine you're in the mood for (most restaurants need reservation for weekend dinners though), here's a list of restaurants and more comprehensive [maps list](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sdoDgR5ZDSESzWAF6) - 

- Korean: *Gaon Korean Restaurant, Seoul Restaurant*
- Mexican: *La Taqueria Chiquitata* (tacos only)
- Chinese: *Tofu and Chili, Lili's Kitchen*
- Ethiopian: *Cafe Lalibela*
- Middle-eastern: *Mani Yppenplatz, Restaurant Apadana*
- Thai: *Papaya, Kamala Thai Imbiss*
- Ramen: *Shoyu Ramen, Taeko Ramen*
- Austrian: *Heindl's Schmarren* (famous for Austrian dessert), *Schweizerhaus* (outdoor beer garden)
- Pizza: *I Ragazzi Pizzeria, Cocore pizzeria*
- Mixed: *Tachles* (famous for peirogis) 

## Shops

If you're visiting Vienna for a few days, you can walk around on Mariahilferstrasse (branded shops) and Burggasse (individual shops and thrift stores) and the area in between to get a good impression of the bustling, commercial areas of Vienna. There are also a lot of cafes and restaurants you can stop to refuel. But if you're a resident, like me, here are some interesting, out-of-the-way shops that are worth going back to - 

- English bookstores - *Shakespeare and Co, Hafi Books*
- Thrift stores for clothes - *Bender Vintage, Burggasee 24*
- Thrift stores for furniture and kitchen items - *Carla Mittersteig*, *Die Glasfabrik* (insanely fancy, but some good finds)
- Food and farmers market - *Naschmarkt* (large outdoor market with a wide range of products), *Hannovermarkt* (amazing fresh produce), *Prosi Exotic Suermarket* (Indian, Asian, African and Latin American grocery products)

## Outdoors

If you're lucky enought to visit Vienna in the few weeks when it's possible to enjoy the outdoors, then take advantage of all the greenery and proximity to water! Here are some things I've enjoyed (or want to enjoy :P) - 

- Swimming: *Krapfenwaldbad* (paid swimming pool in the hills with an amazing view and restaurant), *Donauinsel Grillplatz 9* (shaded spot on Donauinsel that has a nice access to the river)
- Cycling: Great cycling paths on the Donauinsel and Donaukanal, but you can cycle along the Donaukanal to *Freidhof der Namenlosen* (Cemetry of the Nameless). *Prater Hauptallee* is a nice wide road among the woods where you can cycle alongside other people.
- Picnic and parks: *Wahringer park*, *Turkenschanz park* (a little out of the way, but beautiful walking paths) and it's also nice to sit by the Donaukanal near Schwedenplatz
- Uphill walking: Walk up to *Buschenschank Windbauer* on a sunny day in summer to enjoy the view and early wine, or *Kahlenberg* (slightly steeper with a path in the woods) for a higher view of Vienna

If you have any good recommendations for me, don't hesitate to reach out!
