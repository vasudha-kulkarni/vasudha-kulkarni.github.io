My friend Divyansh, introduced me to the idea of [digital gardens](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) -- a digital garden is your corner of the internet, a place for you to explore and write about what interests you, just because it interests you ([Here](https://amandapinsker.com/reading) and [here](https://highlights.melanie-richards.com/) are a couple of really creative digital gardens on books!). I fell in love with the idea immediately. While other bloggers have done wonderful things with this idea, I just wanted to create a digital garden of all the longform articles I've enjoyed and loved. I truly enjoy reading good writing, especially when the author is narrating a story. And when I read a great article on the web, I tend to bookmark it, send it to myself on email or share it with my friends. But ultimately, they end up being scattered across platforms. So, this blog is a collection of all the longform articles I've loved, those that I want to keep going back to. Let me know which one you liked best!

#### Top 3 Recommendations

1. [_Looking for Alice_](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/looking-for-alice) by Henrik Karlsson on his blog, _Escaping Flatand_. An incredibly personal article on how he found his partner, Joanna.
2. [_Listen to Her_](https://shankarraman.in/2020/01/09/listen-to-her/) by T.R. Shankar Raman on his blog, _View from the Elephant Hills_. Raman, an Indian ecologist and conservationist, who has worked on restoring forests in the Western Ghats, read books only by women for an entire year in 2019. 
3. [_Troops_](https://fiftytwo.in/story/troops/) by Monika Mondal on _Fifty-Two_. An on-site analysis of human-wildlife conflict in urban India. _"Monkeys and humans are fighting for space in Indian cities. Right now, it doesn’t look like a winnable war."_

  > _"So much of who I am is tied to the state of my home country, yet I hesitate to bring it up in conversation. War is a three-letter word that functions like a full stop.

  > _"A man — any man, is a companion or a junction but never your identity or your destination. And no man who loves you will waste your time. Please don't while your years away. Very few girls get a 'second chance' of focusing on their existence, let alone a third or a fourth. Before you know it, your relatives will start bringing arranged marriage proposals of men seven years older to you—do not. Okay. Work hard. Very hard. Rest well. Very well. Not only because you want to escape abuse and be safe but also because you deserve to enjoy and be celebrated."_

* [_Trial by Fire_](https://enthucutlet.com/enthuoriginals/playing-with-fire/trial-by-fire/) by Meera Ganapathi

  > _"In fact, I believe that you can spot a seasoned cook by their tolerance to heat. They have fireproof fingers that hold searing iron pans without the trace of a wince. They can be identified with brown-black tattoos on their wrists and arms from years of being splashed by boiling oil and burnt by hot vessels."_

* [_Dating like a Savarna_](https://www.theswaddle.com/dating-like-a-savarna) by Ravikant Kisana

  > _"This English-filtering, becomes a tool of social ostracization (bordering on bullying) and is often the first line of attack and tool for excluding non-elite folks from elite social spaces. But language is not the only social barrier. Even if SC/ST/OBC people master English enough to blend in, they come to painfully realize that the Savarna dating landscape is a much more complex bubble. It is an art curation of cultural capital accrued over a life of intergenerational privilege."_

* [_Eye in the Sky_](https://www.darknlight.com/projects/eye-in-the-sky/) by Anisha Jayadevan

  > _"As I watched the Blue Tiger Moth caterpillar languidly moving up a plant in my husband’s ancestral house in Kasargod, I heard my mother-in-law in the kitchen, cooking breakfast for the rest of the family. Before my husband and I went in to help her, I wondered how women burdened with care-giving find the time and support to access public spaces and observe the wondrous strategies of butterflies to escape predation—when the predator named patriarchy is still very much at large."_

* [_Studying the Antlion Taught Me How to be Human_](https://magazine.catapult.co/column/stories/ambika-kamath-studying-antlion-taught-me-how-to-be-human-behavioral-ecology-science-nature) by Ambika Kamath

  > _"I eventually came to understand that, as a behavioral ecologist, I was asking of the natural world the very questions I was too scared to ask of myself and those around me. I had so many questions about how to exist in this world, and it seemed impossible that a single organism could hold all the answers. Rather, I found that different creatures hold the keys to different doors, with each door leading away from a different difficult situation. After all, any living creature on this planet has an evolutionary history exactly as long as the evolutionary history of any other living creature, stretching billions of years between the moment when life began and right now."_
