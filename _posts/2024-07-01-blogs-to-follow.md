description: A list of the blogs I follow along with my favourite posts.

Most of the articles I read are recommended to me through mailing lists from the blogs that I follow. There are a bunch of blogs about academia that might be of interest to other aspiring academics. I also like reading about books, writing, and other curious things. Here is a list of all the blogs that I follow, with a link to their most interesting posts.

#### 1. _Dynamic Ecology_ by Jeremy Fox, Meghan Duffy and Brian McGill
Their [Friday links](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2024/07/26/friday-links-the-piranha-principle-and-more/) are very topical and interesting. Here is a fun post on what it means to ask [if cats are evolutionarily successful](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2024/02/06/are-cats-evolutionarily-perfect-what-does-that-question-even-mean/) (cat lovers watch out!). Jeremy Fox also has posts analysing the ecology faculty job market in North America.

#### 2. _Scientist Sees Squirrell_ by Stephen B. Heard
Stephen Heard is a professor at University of New Brunswick and writes regularly about interesting nomenclature and scientific writing. His post on [how to get over writer's block](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2022/05/03/getting-past-writers-block/) was very useful. His writing advice is always on point. 

#### 3. _Science for Everyone_ by Terry McGlynn
McGlynn is a professor at Cal State Dominguez Hills and his substack focuses on practical challenges we face as human beings doing science. His view on how repeated moves in academia is a [barrier to broadening representation](https://scienceforeveryone.substack.com/p/needing-to-move-is-a-huge-barrier) is thought-provoking. He also regularly suggests interesting links that we might have missed on his ['Academic Mixedtapes'](https://scienceforeveryone.substack.com/p/academic-mixtape-20). 

#### 4. _Academia Made Easier_ by Loleen Berdahl
This is a newsletter where Loleen shares ideas, hacks, tricks, practices, and automations that have helped her not just survive in academia but made her feel a sense of relative calm. Reading this post on [taking some time to organize](https://loleen.substack.com/p/how-to-invest-an-hour-now-to-make) your upcoming week made me feel validated about [my own methods](/resources/#research-project-organisation) of organisation.

#### 5. _Thesis Whisperer_ by Inger Mewburn
This blog is dedicated to the topic of doing a PhD and 'being an academic in the neo-liberal precarious academy that we (kinda) love'. Mewburn is an academic and director for researcher development at ANU. She has a lot of great writing resources and organizes workshops to help academics write better. I thought that this post on [what neurodivergent PhD students need](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2024/03/02/what-do-neurodivergent-phd-students-need/) was quite interesting. And this post on [academic tidying up](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2024/02/03/the-academic-tidy-up/) speaks to my soul!

#### 6. _Ecology is not a dirty word_ by Manu Sanders
It's a blog maintained by an Australian early-career ecologist that has posts on both, insect ecology and navigating academia. Here is an interesting meta post on [readership and the academic blogosphere](https://ecologyisnotadirtyword.com/2024/01/19/social-media-declines-and-the-academic-blogosphere/).

#### 7. _India Bioscience_
It's a platform that engages with life sciences in academia, industry and government at various levels. Subscribing to their newsletter alerts you to job ooportunities in Indian life sciences realm, and interesting talks and interviews. They invite people to write columns on several topics, including PhD journeys, education, early career experience and so on. Here is an important peace on [money and mental health during PhD](https://indiabioscience.org/columns/indian-scenario/money-mental-health-indian-academia).

#### 8. _Publish not Perish_ by Jenn McClearen
This is a blog for PhD students or early career researchers who want to work on their writing, develop a writing practice and navigate academic culture. Here is an interesting list of strategies to [finding and honing your argument](https://www.publishnotperish.net/p/a-few-strategies-for-finding-your). The posts cover a wide range - from advice on writing grant proposals and literature reviews to focusing on maintaining balance while being a parent. It seems quite useful, but sadly, a lot of the posts require upgrading to a paid subscription.

#### 9. _Research Whisperer_ by Tseen Khoo and Jonathan O'Donnell
They write about research culture, how to navigate grants-speak, building your research track-record and other things academia. Here is an interesting post on [how to write a grant application](https://researchwhisperer.org/2023/12/12/how-long-will-it-take-to-write-an-application/).

<br/><br/>

![Science](/images/blog/blog_sci.png)

#### 1. _Reflections on Paper Past_ by Hari Sridhar
This blog gives you a behind-the-scenes view on seminal papers in ecology and evolution. Sridhar has been interviewing authors to ask them about their experience while working on the paper, what they think of it so many years later and how it has impacted the feild. My favourite is this interview with [Sarah Blaffer Hrdy](https://reflectionsonpaperspast.wordpress.com/2018/01/02/revisiting-hrdy-1974/) on her study of infanticide as a reproductive strategy for male langurs of Abu. The blog now has [a new website](https://reflectionsonpaperspast.com/) with selected quotes, annotated papers, visual archive and more!

#### 2. _Liminal_ by Liz Neeley and Ambika Kamath
They are a science communication collective who help make sense of science. This reflective post in their newsletter by Neeley on how to [navigate through emotions in a rational argument](https://www.liminalcreations.com/newsletter/when-an-immovable-fact-meets-an-unstoppable-feeling) is very stimulating.

#### 3. _Scattterings_ by G. V. Pavan Kumar
This is a blog with interviews of Indian scientists from various disciplines, and several posts by Pavan on the history and process of scientific ideas and development. This blog tries to humanise science and make it accessible to a wider audience.

#### 4. _Rapid Uplift_ by Suvrat Kher
In this newsletter, Kher explores new research in geology and shares his experience of visiting different landscapes and geologic terrains through pictures and videos. Here is an interesting one on [deep sea mining](https://rapiduplift.substack.com/p/rapid-uplift-deep-sea-mining-indian). To be perfectly candid (imitating Rosa Diaz), I sometimes skim through the text when the post gets technical.

![Reading](/images/blog/blog_read.png)

#### 1. _Escaping Flatland_ by Henrik Karlsson
This is a blog by someone who's teachig himself linear algebra, home-schooling his children and puts _a lot_ of thought into his writing. There is everything here from the [childhoods of exceptional people](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/childhoods) to advice on [how to find your life partner](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/looking-for-alice). If there is one blog you take away from this page, let it be this one. 

#### 2. _multi-storied_ by Samanth Subramanian
I was drawn to this blog through Subramanian's biography of JBS Haldane, _A Dominant Character_, which is one of the best non-fiction books I've read. Subramanian is a journalist and through this blog, we get to read his 'takes on old and new stories, glimpses into work-in-agonising-progress, short original writing, and idle chat about journalism'. This post on the [2024 Indian Lok Sabha election](https://samanth.substack.com/p/multi-storied-32-the-details-of-an) was of particular interest to me.

#### 3. _Fifty Two_
52 weeks, 52 ideas. Every week for two years, [_Fifty Two_](https://fiftytwo.in/about/) published an essay that dives deep into an aspect of Indiaâ€™s history, politics and culture. 'Each story will explain, recall or establish something interesting about life on our subcontinent, and tell readers why it matters to them.' I absolutely love this site and every single one of their stories! There's everything from human-animal conflict in Delhi, decline of saris in Pakistan, platonic male-female friendships to an interview of over fifty women named 'Sanjana'!

#### 4. _View from the Elephant Hills_ by T.R. Shankar Raman
Shankar Raman is a wildlife biologist and conservationist turned writer who writes from the Anamalai Hills. This is his personal blog reflecting on his experiences and journeys. I highly recommend this post on his experience reading books written only by women in 2019, titled [_Listen to Her_](https://shankarraman.in/2020/01/09/listen-to-her/).

#### 5. _The Marginalian_ by Maria Popova
Previously titled _Brain Pickings_, this blog stems out of Popova's quest for meaning. She reads vastly about science, philosophy, literature, art -- and brings it all together in her writings. Popova has also written a brilliant book -- [_Figuring_](https://www.themarginalian.org/figuring/) -- exploring the human search for truth and meaning through an epistolary biopgraphy, with beautiful prose, of female scientists, artists, writers and poets from 17th century. I think it's a book everyone should have in their homes. Here is a great post on Rachel Carson's _Silent Spring_ that [started an envrionmental movement in the US](https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/01/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-dorothy-freeman/).


#### 6. _Literary Hub_
[_Literary Hub_](https://lithub.com/) is a website about all things books -- there's literary criticism, new book reviews, reading lists, interviews and tons of articles on a wide range of topics that intersect with literature. Subscribing to their newsletter can feel _a little_ spammy, but it's a great place to visit when you want something new to read.


#### 7. _Nevermind_ by Andrew Potter
In this substack, Potter writes about the 'forgotten history of Gen X'. Here's an interesting post for you - [do you remember your pre-internet brain?](https://nevermindgenx.substack.com/p/do-you-remember-your-pre-internet)
