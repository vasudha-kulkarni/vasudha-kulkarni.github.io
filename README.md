Here are some resources for creating your own static site using Jekyll and hosting it on Github - 

1. Youtube videos - 
  * Detailed tutorial on [Making and hosting your personal website](https://youtu.be/8NkxcaxRacA?si=f1HqjVg2LyAIgBXm) by Graham Northrup
  * [Meet Jekyll](https://youtu.be/F8iOU1ci19Q?si=0iU0keJaC3x6YjgN) by Techno Tim
  * [How to create a free website using Gihub pages](https://youtu.be/o5g-lUuFgpg?si=ZRVb0u5gh8VX3SB5) by Tony Teaches Tech
2. Jekyll is a static site generator written in the programming language Ruby. Installing Ruby on your system can be the bottleneck. Here's a super useful article about [Ruby on Mac](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/) by Moncef Belyamani. Caveat: The article insists there's no need for a Ruby package manager, but you're going to need one (I used 'rbenv').
3. You can build your website from scratch or use a pre-made Jekyll template (Al Folio is a popular one for academic websites). Here are some useful websites - 
  * [Jekyll resources](https://jekyllrb.com/resources/)
  * [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/)
  * [jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io/)
  * [jekyllthemes.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/)
4. Some other options 
  * HTML templates website - [HTML5up](https://html5up.net/)
  * [Carrd](https://carrd.co/) - one page, simple website with premium account options
