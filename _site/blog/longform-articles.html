<p>My friend Divyansh, introduced me to the idea of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/">digital gardens</a> – a digital garden is your corner of the internet, a place for you to explore and write about what interests you, just because it interests you (<a href="https://amandapinsker.com/reading">Here</a> and <a href="https://highlights.melanie-richards.com/">here</a> are a couple of really creative digital gardens on books!). I fell in love with the idea immediately. While other bloggers have done wonderful things with the idea, I wanted to create a digital garden of all the longform articles I’ve enjoyed and loved. I truly enjoy reading good writing, especially when the writer is narrating a story. And when I read a great article on the web, I tend to bookmark it, send it to myself on email or share it with my friends. But ultimately, they end up being scattered everywhere. This blog is a collection of all the longform articles I’ve loved, that I want to keep going back to. Let me know which one you liked best!</p>

      <p><em>“A man—any man, is a companion or a junction but never your identity or your destination. And no man who loves you will waste your time. Please don’t while your years away. Very few girls get a ‘second chance’ of focusing on their existence, let alone a third or a fourth. Before you know it, your relatives will start bringing arranged marriage proposals of men seven years older to you—do not. Okay. Work hard. Very hard. Rest well. Very well. Not only because you want to escape abuse and be safe but also because you deserve to enjoy and be celebrated.”</em></p>

But language is not the only social barrier. Even if SC/ST/OBC people master English enough to blend in, they come to painfully realize that the Savarna dating landscape is a much more complex bubble. It is an art curation of cultural capital accrued over a life of intergenerational privilege.”</em></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>“I eventually came to understand that, as a behavioral ecologist, I was asking of the natural world the very questions I was too scared to ask of myself and those around me. I had so many questions about how to exist in this world, and it seemed impossible that a single organism could hold all the answers. Rather, I found that different creatures hold the keys to different doors, with each door leading away from a different difficult situation. After all, any living creature on this planet has an evolutionary history exactly as long as the evolutionary history of any other living creature, stretching billions of years between the moment when life began and right now.”</em></p>
